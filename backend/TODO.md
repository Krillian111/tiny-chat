# TO DOs

## Possible Cleanup / Improvements

- integrate public key validation into fastify's validation framework
- (de)serialize websocket messages with fastify's serialization library instead of `JSON.parse`

## Next

- message handler
- broadcast users joining/exiting to all

## Finishing touches

- document what I learned
